       <p>Hello! Welcome to my portal page. This page will display links to my projects, Github, and LinkedIn. Feel free to look around my portal and get to know me!</p>
       
       <p>I excel in activities that involve the need to problem-solve while also requiring physical interaction. I can work in any work environment whether it be in a classroom, office, or even at home. I have a passion to compete whether that be in sports, games, or academics. My sense of competitiveness allows me to produce positive results that would otherwise not have been possible.</p>
       
       <p>My name is JR Fernandez. I am an upcoming professional learning software development in a program called Year Up. I am currently working in the service industry at Din Tai Fung as a server where I strengthened my soft skills, quick problem solving, collaboration, and leadership. I also have prior experience in aerospace engineering having a diploma with honors where I learned hard skills and how to problem solve in more technical ways. Although I have already achieved something in the STEM field I decided that aerospace engineering was not aligned with my goals and dreams and started my new journey in a new field. I looked for ways for me to jumpstart into the tech industry and that is where I found this program called Year Up. Year Up is a program that helps people ages 18-29 years old to job opportunities in the tech industry. It has two phases, phase one is the learning and developing phase where you learn all the needed soft and hard skills. The second phase is the internship phase where you learn and work under a company. There are several tracks you can choose from in Year Up, but I chose the application development track as it was heavily aligned with my new goals. Year Up has been wonderful so far with not only introducing me into the tech industry, but also reinforcing my soft skills and professionalism through multiple business classes and many group projects. I have now become more developed both professionally and emotionally. That is what brought me here today where my current goal is to build a strong resume through informative internships so that I can become a software developer within a tech company. </p>
           

    <p> Warm regards, </p>
